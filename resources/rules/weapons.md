# RANGED WEAPON TYPES

There are five types of ranged weapon: [Assault](), [Heavy](), [Rapid Fire](), [Grenade]() and [Pistol](). A weapon’s type can impact the number of attacks it can make. In addition, each type of ranged weapon also has an additional rule that, depending upon the situation, might affect the accuracy of the weapon or when it can be fired. These are as follow

---

## **Assault**
##### *Assault weapons fire so rapidly or indiscriminately that they can be shot from the hip as warriors dash forwards into combat.*

If a unit includes any models equipped with Assault weapons, that unit is still eligible to shoot with in your [Shooting phase]() even if it has Advanced this turn, but you can only [resolve attacks]() using those Assault weapons when you select that unit to shoot with. If a model shoots an Assault weapon in the same turn in which its unit has Advanced, subtract 1 from hit rolls when resolving that weapon’s attacks.

## **Heavy**
##### *Heavy weapons are amongst the biggest guns on the battlefield, but they require bracing to fire at full effect and are unwieldy to bring to bear at close quarters.*

When an **INFANTRY** model shoots a Heavy weapon, subtract 1 from the [hit rolls]() when resolving that weapon’s attacks if the firing model’s unit has moved for any reason this turn (e.g. it made a [Normal Move]() this turn).

## **Rapid fire**
##### *Rapid fire weapons are versatile armaments capable of aimed single shots at long range or controlled bursts of fire at close quarters.*

When a model shoots a Rapid Fire weapon, double the [number of attacks]() it makes if its target is within half the weapon’s range.

## **Grenade**
##### *Grenades are handheld explosive devices that a warrior throws at the enemy while their squad mates provide covering fire.*

When a unit shoots, one model that is equipped with a Grenade in that unit can [resolve attacks]() with it instead of shooting any other weapons.

## **Pistol**
##### *Due to their compact size, pistols can even be used in melee to shoot at point-blank range.*

A model can make attacks with a Pistol even when its unit is within [Engagement Range]() of enemy units, but it must target an enemy unit that is within Engagement Range of its own unit when it does so. In such circumstances, the model can target an enemy unit even if other friendly units are within Engagement Range of the same enemy unit.

When a model equipped with both a Pistol and another type of ranged weapon (e.g. a Pistol and a [Rapid Fire]() weapon) shoots, it can either shoot with its Pistol(s) or with its other ranged weapons. Choose which it will fire (Pistols or non-Pistols) before selecting targets.

## **Blast weapons**
Some weapons have ‘Blast’ listed in their profile’s abilities. These are referred to as Blast weapons. In addition to the normal rules, the following rules apply to Blast weapons:

1. If a Blast weapon targets a unit that has between 6 and 10 models, it always makes a minimum of 3 attacks. So if, when determining how many attacks are made with that weapon, the dice rolled results in less than 3 attacks being made, make 3 attacks instead. For example, if a [Grenade D6]() weapon with the Blast rule targets a unit that has 6 or more models, and you roll a 2 to determine how many attacks are made, that roll is counted as being a 3 and that weapon makes three attacks against that unit.
   
2. When a Blast weapon targets a unit that has 11 or more models, do not roll dice to randomly determine how many attacks are made – instead, make the maximum possible [number of attacks](). For example, if a Grenade D6 weapon with the Blast rule targets a unit that has 11 or more models, that weapon makes six attacks against that unit.

Blast weapons can never be used to make attacks against a unit that is within Engagement Range of the firing model’s unit, even if the weapon has the Pistol type or if the firing model is a **VEHICLE** or a **MONSTER** – firing high-explosives at point-blank range is simply unwise.
